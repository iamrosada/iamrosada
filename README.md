# Welcome to my Github!👋

Hi everyone, I'm **Luís de Água Rosada, I'm Angolan**, I'm 23 years old I'm a **Second year student** in the **Computer Science** course applied at **VSUET* * ✍️ in the city of **Voronezh in Russia** where I live so far. I had my first contact with programming in high school working with Micro C, but I didn't really deepen my knowledge of this technology.

###🌏**The more I know, the more I am**🧑🏿‍💻

 Being in Russia ✈️ in 2020 I met **Rocketseat**, but it wasn't until August 2020 that I started studying 🚀 Reactjs. In this year of 2021 I developed an application to test my knowledge, it was built with **Typescript, Nodejs and Docker in the backend and Front Reactjs, Javascript and Eletronjs**, *I made it to help in the management of Foreign Students, allowing high-speed data synchronization, allowing departments far apart from each other to share and access the same student data, unfortunately the university is not using the application (the university should only use applications developed by foreigners with Government authorization ). I just received praise, but it was good, I did my first deploy on **Heroku**, and it was this application that made use of the **S3 of amazon aws**. and I want to learn more things that's why I'm here.*
